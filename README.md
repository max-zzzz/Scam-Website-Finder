# Scam-Website-Finder
Tool to find newly registered potential scam websites


1. Go to https://www.whoisdownload.com/newly-registered-domains and download any .zip file from the last 4 days with tons of newly registered domains
then put the .txt file in a folder
2. Download the python file in the same folder
3. Run the python file in Terminal with "python3 websitefilterer.py" (check that you have python3 installed)
4. If everything is correct, it will ask you for keywords to filter out websites, to find some scam websites I recommend using "microsoft,support,windows,247,tech,apple" and so on
